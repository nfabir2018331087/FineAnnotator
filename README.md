# FineAnnotator

### Project Overview
In this era of deep learning, data is the bedrock of any model, including Chatgpt, which requires a substantial quantity of high-quality annotated data. A significant amount of data that has been annotated is required for any model to perform effectively. If the researchers were to complete the annotation assignments on their own, it would be rather challenging. They need to find people to work for them to accomplish that goal. FineAnnotator can bridge the gap between researchers and students since researchers require a large workforce to annotate data according to their requirements, and students like us want to work part-time jobs that are convenient for us. Students can select the assignment that best suits their interests on the FineAnnotator website.
